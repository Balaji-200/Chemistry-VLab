# About
<p><b>Chemistry V-Lab</b> is specifically prepared on the concept of learn through games. As games have different levels to pass through, V-Lab gives the similar experience to users. The students can test their knowledge in initial levels in the form of nice visual graphics. Once they clear all the knowledge game levels, they can go to the last level which is simulation of experiment.</p
<p>The Objective of this virtual lab is to provide remote access to experiments in Chemistry at the undergraduate level of Engineering. Students can use any device as the software is user friendly.</p>
<p>Chemistry V-Lab was ideated and conceptualised by <b>Prof. Sonaali Borkar</b> and the content was developed by <b>Prof. Nilima Main</b> of Applied Science department of first year engineering of Vidyalakar Institute of Technology.</p>
<p><b>Mr. Balaji Durai Masanam</b>, a second-year student of Electronics and Telecommunication, Vidyalankar Institute of Technology has developed the virtual laboratory for Engineering Chemistry.</p>
<p><i><b>Note</b>: This lab is prepared purely for educational purpose and for usage by First Year Engineering students.</i></p>
